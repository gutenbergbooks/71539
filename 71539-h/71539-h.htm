<h2 class="nobreak">ADDRESS.</h2>

</div>

<p>Upon the occasion of addressing, for the first
time, a particular class, and that too through the
medium of a decidedly class-paper, it seems to us
that the views and intentions of its conductor
should be unreservedly stated. We commence,
then, in the spirit that will characterize our future
advocacy of the varied interests enumerated in
another page. It is avowed that we enter upon
this portion of the wide field of literature and
science as our legitimate province, inasmuch as
we were brought up, educated, and have long
wrought in it; mere qualification for any undertaking
is, however, but one amongst the elements
of success, and unless combined with well-timed
efforts, frequently disappoints the possessor:—we
invite the reader to judge of the timeliness of our
own by the following incident, the explanations it
gives rise to, and of the result in the publication
before him.</p>

<p>Conversing a few months since with a leading
bookseller and publisher in this metropolis, we
had occasion to remark upon the costly, not to
say exorbitant, price of Architectural books; this
fact was not disputed, and the cause at once
ascribed to the smallness of the number of readers,
which made it impossible it should be otherwise.
We almost held up our hands in astonishment, as
we repeated his words “smallness of the number
of readers!” Call you five hundred thousand a
small number? Can a class of half a million
male adults, whom we may emphatically term all
readers, and members of reading families; a class
of half a million of the pick of British Artisans;
a class of the highest intelligence, and (measured
by their wages and numbers) highest in wealth:
can we talk of the smallness of the number of
readers, and assume to know any thing of this
large and influential body? It was in this strain
that we interrogated our friend the bookseller; it
was a burst of somewhat indignant feeling, for we
had long thought on the subject, and felt convinced
that the fault lay, not with the reader,
but rather with the writer and publisher. We
have since put the case in a familiar way to other
parties, as we will now proceed to do to <i>our</i>
readers.</p>

<p>Suppose the Grocers, whose business it is to
supply the commodities of their shops in a way
suited to the daily wants of customers, were to act
upon the principle of refusing to parcel out their
tea and sugar, or to dispose of it in less quantities
than a chest of the former, or a hundred weight
of the latter; or, bringing the parallel nearer,
suppose the Bakers, in dispensing the “staff of
life,” were to set themselves above the standard of
purveying the quartern, and half-quartern loaf;
or again, that the Butcher should sell his meat in
nothing less than the carcase; or that these tradesmen
were to study only the palate and appetite of
dainty and refined stomachs; what, let us ask,
would be the condition of men of moderate means,
and homely requirements? Why, just that which
in regard to the food of the mind is the condition
of the Working Builder.</p>

<p>There are in England, Scotland, and Wales,
one hundred and twenty thousand Carpenters, of
full age, and we may assume for Ireland (the
compiled accounts not assisting us here) thirty
thousand more, making a total of one hundred and
fifty thousand, exclusive of apprentices, in this
trade alone, who, in common with the other co-operating
Building Artificers, require to read and
study (and in some instances to abstruseness) on
all subjects connected with their craft. For
these hundreds of thousands there has hitherto
been no retailing of proper food for the mind; no
books at moderate prices, and in suitable parcels;
and if we except the issue in parts and numbers of
works such as those of Mr. Peter Nicholson, the
large sale of which confirms the truth of our
convictions, nothing in the shape of a trade instructor,
or magazine, adapted to their several
pursuits has yet been offered to this immense
body. The “Architectural Magazine,” by Mr.
London, indeed, did wonders in its way; and
other journals which have followed in its track
are, no doubt, well adapted to the particular
departments whose cause they espouse, and promote;<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
but what is there, we ask again, for the
work-shop, and for the fire-side circle of the
Building Artisan?</p>

<p>Examine our <span class="smcap">Prospectus</span>, and contemplate the
numbers forming an array of what we have advisedly
termed “the pick of British Artisans.”
Be it remembered, however, that we do not use
these words in an invidious sense, or in disparagement
of other bodies of the industrious citizens of
the empire; but, considering the standard of perfection,
in body and mind, required for the proper
practising of the Building Arts, and considering
also the healthful nature of their occupations, it
will not be deemed arrogant in us to speak thus of
the class to which we have the honour to belong;
in addition, we have the influence which numbers,
intelligence, and wealth, if united, must ever secure
to us. With all these advantages present to
literary eyes and ears, in an age of professed
catering, printing, and publishing, is it not one of
the greatest marvels—a huge paradox—that there
is no such thing as a <i>Builder’s Newspaper and
Magazine</i>?</p>

<p>We have just said Newspaper and Magazine,
for it has occurred to us (rather happily, we opine
and trust), to combine them; that is to say, the
particular features which distinguish either.
We would relieve the Working Builder from a
double charge for matter less available to him in
practice, as well as from the still greater evil, in
many instances, of a dry magazine at home, and a
well moistened newspaper at a public-house. We
have an eye to the superior household and domestic
economy which prevails, and which we would
have still more constant in the Builder’s Circle.
We would give him a book on his trade, worth
preserving, and a newspaper for the reading of his
wife and family, as well as for himself; and,
finally, we would make the weekly pence set apart
from his earnings, for the gratification of a common
feeling of curiosity, not begrudged by the
partner of his cares on the one hand, or to be regretted
by the most thrifty economist on the other,
since, even the news will be the vehicle of trade
knowledge, and consequently of the means of
trade, with its advantages and profits.</p>

<p>In designating our paper, we use the word
“Builder” in its most extended sense—instancing
a house, or other edifice, we regard it from the
procurement and preparation of the materials, to
the fixing upon its site, and to its full completion
for the residence, use, and enjoyment of man, and
which includes the making of the design or plan,
“breaking” ground, as it is termed; the erection,
or building up; decorating, fitting, and furnishing;
the supply of water and drainage; and even
the laying out of the garden, pleasure grounds,
and park. This is the whole art of building, or, in
other words, of providing and perfecting human
habitations. To all, therefore, who are engaged
in the Art so defined, we address ourselves without
distinction, and without preference; the interests
of all will, to the best of our power, be consulted,
promoted, and advocated.</p>

<p>It now becomes us to say a few words as to
how far this step (that is, the issuing of the “<span class="smcap">Precursor
Number</span>”) is to be considered on our
part as an experiment; for, without being clear and
explicit, we should, in case of failure, or rather
abandonment, of our enterprise (for failure there
can be none, where provision is made against that
result), incur the blame of not having given our
friends, the Building Classes, a clear view of the
part which we humbly conceive it is their duty
and interest to take in the business.</p>

<p>The “Precursor” is a <i>trial number</i>; and we
make the avowal plainly and distinctly. Our part
of the affair is to make every effort to supply what
we consider a useful and most desirable public
object. The part of the building fraternity, to
whom it is particularly addressed, and the part of
those who regard as a duty all the exertions they
are making in the cause of public education; and
also of those who pursue the arts out of a pure
love and liking, is to support our humble efforts if
they deem them worthy of appreciation. The
less the sacrifice called for on either side the better.
Let the covenants between us be of an equitable
nature, and as we start upon the principle
of discountenancing, as far as practicable, all lottery
and riskful speculation (of which we will say
more presently), so in the basis of this compact
with our friends and readers, we would remove
all unnecessary hazard, or complexion of adventure.
We give our best exertion in what appears
to us a work of common good; if our friends
think well and approvingly of these exertions, and
that work, let them contribute their part, were it
alone for economy and fairness sake.</p>

<p>We do not rely upon the leviathan power
of capital for our success; but we purpose building
it up by an honest and diligent pursuit of the
objects defined, aided by a fair share of judgment,
and other necessary qualifications; and we anticipate
it in the cheerful and generous response
of our countrymen: and this Precursor Number,
as its name implies, has its office in searching out
the way, and exploring the track which its successor
“<span class="smcap">The Builder</span>” is designed to follow.
If the Precursor finds a ready passport, and a
significant welcome, of which we have no doubt,
it will be promptly followed by that of which it
will have been the harbinger.</p>

<p>We invite, therefore, an active dispersion of the
Precursor amongst our friends; but, above all,
we respectfully invite communications from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
many distinguished patrons and favourers of
works of this class. We invite also the Architect,
Engineer, Landscape Gardener, Master Builder,
Manufacturers in ornamental processes, and proprietors
generally, Clerks of Works, Foremen,
and Workmen, to avail themselves of the ready
means of the penny-postage, to aid us by their
supporting voices, and by any suggestions they
can commit to paper. A Supplement will be issued
with a subsequent impression of the Precursor
(without increase of price), and in that Supplement
our correspondence, and additional advertisements
will appear; we, therefore, scarcely need say
that the more promptly our friends reply to the
invitation the better.</p>

<p>It now remains for us to say something of the
peculiar character proposed to be given to the
“Builder.” The Prospectus, which serves as the
basis of this exposition, sets forth that the trade
essays and descriptions will be accompanied by
illustrations and diagrams: that is, we shall supply
drawings, to render clearer the accounts we may
give of mechanical inventions and processes;
drawings of ornament, or enrichment in Plasterwork,
Painting, Sculpture, Carving, Iron, and
other metals; drawings of Mouldings, and
Moulded work, for the Carpenter, Mason, and
Bricklayer; drawings of <i>construction</i>, in roofs,
floors, trusses, and framing, hand-railing, &amp;c.,
centering of arches and groining; drawings of
Buildings, both ancient and modern; plans,
elevations, sections, and details: drawings of
Architectural orders and styles; drawings for instruction
in perspective, geometry, and the like;
and, occasionally, coloured printing, in such matters
as pertain to painting and staining.</p>

<p>We shall also give patterns for the paperhanger
and upholsterer, and designs for furniture;
and a comprehensive range of constructive
and ornamental design suited to that immense
territory of British pre-eminence, the Iron-foundry
and its workshops: as connected with
these, we come to that creative and directing
science, Civil Engineering, and here drawings of
constructed works, of Engines and Machinery,
will have a prominent place, accompanying the
descriptive treatises and essays.</p>

<p>From this enumeration it must be evident that
a large space will be devoted to the sciences in
the nature of connected and consecutive essays;
another part to the record of progress in the
Building Art; and a third to news relating to
Building and Builders.</p>

<p>Reviews and notices of publications intended
for or likely to be useful to Builders, will also be
given, and biographical sketches of eminent men
connected with science and the arts. These separate
heads, together with correspondence and
inquiries, will constitute the peculiarities of our
Journal, and the remaining space will assume the
aspect of the general weekly press—home and
foreign news; digest of Parliamentary reports;
political opinions of the leading Journals; dramatic
notices; general literary reviews; police and
law reports; markets, and advertisements.</p>

<p>So ample is the field before us, that there can
be no lack of matter or subjects; our business
will be to cull the choicest for the literary banquet
of our friends. Much that is valuable we hope
and look for in the shape of correspondence; one
of the chief merits of “<span class="smcap">The Builder</span>” being, that
it is a direct and fitting medium for conveying
instruction from the liberal and enlightened of
every department—a free exchange of knowledge—which
we anticipate may result in mutual good
service to all.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">WILLIAM OF WYKEHAM.</h2>

</div>

<p>We have selected the portraiture of this illustrious
man, whose fame lives in national works,
as the first wherewith to embellish our <span class="smcap">Gallery
of Architects</span>—a man who was eminent, not
only as an architect, but as a liberal patron of the
arts—not only as a builder of colleges, but as a
munificent donor to the cause of education, and
whose institutions still flourish among the proudest
in the land. “Many there are,” says Bishop
Lowth, in his Life of Wykeham, “who have felt
the influence of his liberality, or who are actually
partakers of his bounty.”</p>

<p>It is rarely that instances approaching in interest
to that of our subject present themselves; of successful
talent we have many, but they are limited
to its mere exercise for ordinary reward; others,
where ambition and ostentation, as in the case of
Wolsey, stimulated to a patronage of great works,
while in that of Wykeham we have a memorable
example of true nobility of mind, soaring from
humble origin to the most elevated stations in
church and state, and fulfilling its duties by an
active exercise of all the kindred virtues.</p>

<p>William of Wykeham was born at the village of
that name in Hampshire, in the year 1324, of reputable
but poor parents, whose deficiency of means
to afford him education was supplied by the generous
intervention of Nicholas Uvedale, lord of the
manor of Wykeham, and constable of Winchester
Castle, then one of the great offices of the kingdom.
After going through the course of study afforded
by the school at Winchester, we find him
officiating as secretary to Uvedale, and subsequently
executing commissions of trust as attorney
for Edyngdon, Bishop of Winchester, his immediate
predecessor in that see, in whose service he
appears at that time to have been engaged.</p>

<p>The piety, diligence, and early acquirements of
Wykeham had recommended him to the notice of
many patrons, both lay and ecclesiastical, and
paved the way for his introduction to that of the
reigning monarch, Edward III., and of his son,
the renowned Black Prince; he had already entered
the subordinate ranks of the clergy, and the
fitness of his choice was confirmed in after times
by the dignities he attained to; that elevation was,
however, preceded by the execution of works
which have stamped his fame as an Architect.</p>

<p>It is natural that we should ask, how was this
talent in architecture acquired? We find no
account of the preparation or training, beyond
that of the general knowledge he had gained at
the school of Winchester, aided by the intuitive
genius and taste proper to comprehensive intellectual
powers. No record exists of his having
studied at either of the universities, and if it had
been so, the regard and confidence of the King
must be attributed to acquirements very superior
to those at that time current at Oxford or Cambridge,
where theological controversy was the
leading and absorbing theme. We are told, indeed,
that Wykeham had studied “arithmetic,
mathematics, divinity, and, above all, the canon
and civil law;” and we see no reason to the contrary.
The school of Winchester, a city then
second to none in the kingdom in splendour and
opulence, would scarcely be deficient of teachers
in these courses of study; in the mode, and according
to the then understanding of their relative
uses and value.</p>

<p>It is, upon the whole, probable that Wykeham
gave the first proofs of skill as an Architect in the
extension and reparation of Winchester Castle,
during his employment by Nicholas Uvedale. That
it was a fortress of considerable extent and consequence,
history abundantly proves; and it continued
so down to the period of the civil strife
between the adherents of Charles I. and the
Parliamentary armies; but whatever may have
been the extent or description of building previously
executed by him, it led to his appointment,
by patent, dated May 10th, 1356, of Clerk
of all the King’s works in the manors of Henley
and Yesthampstead; and by a second patent,
under date 30th October of the same year, he was
made Surveyor of all the King’s works at the
Castle and Park of Windsor; and subsequently of
all the royal castles south of Trent.</p>

<p>In these capacities he was furnished with extensive
powers; such as directing the issue of the
King’s writ to the sheriffs of counties, requiring
them to impress workmen, who were compelled
to labour at fixed wages; to purvey and apply all
material fitted for building; to hold courts for
pleas of trespass and misdemeanours; and to inquire
of the King’s liberties and rights within his
demesne lands. The prelude to the erection of
Windsor Castle was the assembling of 360 impressed
workmen, by forties, from nine adjoining
counties, in addition to those voluntarily engaged;
the original Norman building was levelled, and
on its site, under the eye of a warlike monarch
who delighted in embattled towers and gorgeous
halls fitted for the display of chivalric institutions,
was reared this far-famed fortress and palace of
our kings.</p>

<p>Windsor Castle occupied from ten to twelve
years of continued labour, and comprised the
King’s palace; the great hall of St. George;
buildings for various purposes, on the east and
south sides of the upper ward; the keep, or tower;
the chapel of St. George; the residences of the
custos and canons, in the lower ward, with the
whole circumference of the walls, towers, and
gates. Many parts of the original building
remain, but the lapse of nearly five hundred years,
frequent repairs, the enlargements and alterations
required to meet the conveniences or tastes of
successive kings, most of whom have expended
immense sums in real or fancied improvements,
have, in a great degree, obliterated a plan and
style which was, in Castellated Architecture, the
perfection of the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>His second work was the Castle of Queenborough,
in the Isle of Sheppy, which, from the lowness
of the site, and nature of the foundations, required
unusual skill in the Architect. It was commenced
in 1361, and completed in about six years, when
the King, holding his court there, made the town
a free borough, naming it Queenborough, in
honour of his Queen Philippa. Of this structure
no part remains; but its position and extent are
ascertained by the moat which surrounded it.
There can be no doubt this was one of the principal
castles of the kingdom, designed both as a
means of defence against invasion, and as a point
for the assembling of fleets and armies for offensive
purposes. We are told of this building, that
it was “large, strong, and magnificent;” a fitting
residence for royalty, and one of the strongholds
of the realm; and its importance may be estimated
by the rank of its constables, who were, in the
reign of Edward III., John of Gaunt, Duke of
Lancaster; Richard II., Robert de Vere, Earl of
Oxford; Henry IV., John Cornwall, Baron Fanhope;
Henry VII., Humphry Stafford, Duke of
Buckingham; Edward IV., George, Duke of
Clarence, &amp;c. The last repairs were done in the
reign of Henry VIII., 1536.</p>

<p>Pending these works, Wykeham grew into high
favour with his royal master, and church preferment
was heaped upon him with a lavish hand;
he filled also in succession the offices of Secretary
of State, Keeper of the Privy Seal, and Chancellor
of England; and upon the death of Edyngdon,
Bishop of Winchester, in 1366, he succeeded to
that see, one of the richest and most influential
in the kingdom. With his career as a prelate or
a statesman, we can have little to do in this sketch,
but we may be permitted to notice that it was replete
with great and disinterested actions. Prosperity
so brilliant had, however, its hour of adversity,
but which only served to place in bolder relief
the virtues of the Christian and the dignity
of the man. In the dotage of Edward III., charges
of malversation, in the execution of his high offices,
were preferred against the Bishop of Winchester,
at the instigation of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster,
who had always manifested an irreconcilable
jealousy of his influence with the king.
This proceeding was followed by an arbitrary
sequestration of the temporalities of the bishop,
and he retired to the monastery of Merton, and
subsequently to the Abbey of Waverly, near
Farnham, amid the universal regrets of the nation.
The aspersion of a character so singularly exempt
from the besetting sin of avarice, and its
twin vices, peculation and sensualism, could not,
however, be long sustained; and at the end of
seven months he was happily restored to the
means of carrying forward magnificent designs
for the benefit of posterity.</p>

<p>From this period Wykeham seems, as much as
possible, to have relieved himself from the burthen
of secular affairs, although we find him again
Chancellor in the unsettled reign of Richard II.,
but which office he took the earliest occasion to
resign. Long and faithful services to the state
had entitled him to repose; but there was no cessation
in the activity of a mind fraught with benevolent
purposes. Possessed of great wealth, he
seems to have considered himself but as a steward
intrusted with a useful application of it, and he
devised, with as much judgment as human foresight
is permitted to exercise, the establishments
we are now to mention.</p>

<p>With the year 1373 began the formation of a
school at Oxford, that of Winchester having much
earlier been taken under his especial care; at
each, masters were provided, and scholars, to the
number of seventy, lodged and boarded at his sole
charge. These were, however, but preliminary
steps to the great and original plans contemplated,
namely, the founding of colleges at Oxford and
Winchester, with buildings, masters, and suitable
appointments, and a perpetual maintenance for
two hundred scholars, who, while receiving the
advantage of liberal support, were trained from
elementary learning through the whole circle of
the sciences. So costly was this undertaking, that
no individual, with a single exception, has had the
means or generosity to emulate the example. This
occurred in the person of King Henry VI., whose
colleges at Eton and Cambridge were founded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
upon principles scarcely varying from these
models.</p>

<p>Wykeham was now fifty-five years old, and, in
realizing his plans, found full scope for the display
of matured genius. Neither the cares of state
which he had encountered, nor the personal ease
which so frequently inclines even great minds to
passive inaction, could obliterate his predilections
for architecture. Under this master of his art
were perfected improvements in Gothic style which
have procured for examples of this period the distinction
of the <i>pure or decorated English</i>. These
consist in increased boldness, highly wrought and
varied sculpture, and enriched vaultings, with exterior
ornaments of statuary, niched or canopied,
upon the western or great entrance fronts of ecclesiastical
buildings. With the taste to dictate and
the wealth to execute such magnificent designs, he
entered upon his tasks, and, in 1379, personally
laid the first stone of the college familiarly termed
New College, Oxford, but by himself “Sainte
Marie College of Winchestre in Oxenford,” which
was completed and its establishment inducted with
much ceremony in 1386.</p>

<p>We may here be permitted to observe, that with
every disposition to dwell upon the details and
beauties of this and his succeeding works, want of
space compels us, for the moment, to relinquish
an intention to do so; but, as subjects of national
interest, we shall recur to them, aided by illustrations
calculated to render many peculiarities of
this style available in modern practice.</p>

<p>But to resume our brief notices. Scarcely a
year elapsed before the second, or St. Mary’s
College, at Winchester, was in progress, and in
six years fitted for the reception of its professors
and students. In extent and style this edifice
bears the strong impress of its founder, whose
memory lives freshly in the veneration of his
children, for such we may term those who are
here nurtured and taught, and from amongst
whom have stood forth many worthies of the
church, and others of the highest attainments in
science.</p>

<p>The next, and last, work of this eminent and
excellent prelate, the construction of the western
front, and the nave and aisles of his cathedral at
Winchester, was commenced in 1394, and the
70th of his age; and in this instance the unimpaired
vigour of his conceptions, and the extreme
liberality with which he appropriated his resources,
are equally subjects for lasting admiration.
It was built by Walklyn, the first Norman
bishop after the conquest; and in its governing
features, <i>extent and massiveness</i>, is in the style so
called. We have before mentioned the western
front as the work of Wykeham, which, though
mutilated by barbarian fanaticism, retains much of
its splendour, and is a marked example of his
manner. Entering by this door-way, we are at
once upon the scene of his mightiest achievement;—the
eye becomes fixed for a moment by the
gorgeous colouring of the eastern window, then
wanders upwards amidst the infinite tracery and
adornment of the vault, and, having scanned the
vastness of the pile, seeks repose in a more leisure
examination of the isolated, but not less beautiful,
objects of sculpture below.</p>

<p>Apart from associations and impressions induced
by the aspect of Gothic temples upon the
great scale, we here find the elements of solidity,
propriety, and uniformity carefully preserved,
and the enrichments distributed with a masterly
hand; the groining of the roof springs from single
shafts rising from octangular bases; the capitals
are highly embellished with busts and foliage,
and the frieze charged with bold and finely-sculptured
bosses; in fact, we have here before us an
<i>era in the Gothic style</i>, and a perfect adaptation of
its capabilities, carried out with all the originality
that distinguished the genius of the architect.</p>

<p>The various writers who have treated on the antiquities
of Winchester agree that the effect produced
by the columnar vista of the nave, in combination
with the group of chantries and screens,
is not surpassed by any spot in England, or in Europe.
In minute Gothic, or shrine-work, it is
also unrivalled. The tomb of Wykeham, executed,
according to the practice of the middle
ages, under his own direction, is the purest of all
authorities in this style: it is placed within the
mortuary chapel, or chantry, occupying the fifth
arch from the west end, and is rich in canopies
and tabernacle work; the latter originally contained
statues of saints, particularly that of the
Virgin, which stood against the same pillar, when
in his youth he had worshipped here; but these
have long since been destroyed, and the tomb despoiled
also of the enchased escutcheons which
adorned it. The marble figure represents the prelate
as possessing full features, and a placid, benign,
and intelligent countenance; it is clothed in
full episcopal costume, the head resting upon a
pillow supported by angels, and at the feet are
three figures of one of the religious orders, in the
attitude of prayer.</p>

<p>The life so usefully spent closed in the year
1404, leaving more durable and splendid memorials
than it has been the lot of any other individual
to rear. Having, for nearly half a century,
held the highest stations, and possessed almost unbounded
influence, we find it to have been exerted
in a spirit far in advance of his times; and personal
aggrandizement grew upon him as a consequence
of undeviating integrity and universal benevolence;
these great and marked qualities were evinced in
pure and unabated loyalty to his prince, courtesies
and services to his equals of the church and the
nobles of the land; and, above all, in the kindness,
forbearance, and mercy which he caused to
be exercised towards the people of a yet unenlightened
age.</p>

<p>William of Wykeham expired at his manor
house, or palace, of Waltham, Hants, A.D. 1404,
in the eightieth year of his age, and his remains
rest under the tomb we have described. His life
affords, perhaps, the most brilliant example on
record of the combined power of industry and
genius; the industry to acquire knowledge, and
the genius to apply it in advance of preceding
theories. His earliest employments seem to have
been merely such as a tolerably well-educated man
of the fourteenth century would find little difficulty
in obtaining. Architecture was his diverging
point from the monotony of ordinary life
towards the greatness he achieved, his first essays
appearing to have resulted from opportunities
which casually fell in his way, but embraced with
an alacrity inspired by self-confidence. Having
once engaged in it, his fondness for the science
knew no abatement, for however lofty his position
in the state, or onerous his duties as a churchman,
he found leisure to cultivate it; and having engrafted
new and more impressive features upon the style he
delighted in, may be said to have died in the
exercise of <i>this profession</i>, just before the completion
of his cathedral at Winchester.</p>

<p>So exalted were the stations and so extensive
the influence he possessed, that the spirit of benevolence
by which he was actuated had full scope
for exertion. While serving his prince with unswerving
loyalty, he found means to protect the
people from oppression and exactions, and by
numerous courtesies and services to the nobility,
won them to a milder exercise of their territorial
privileges; while in the relations of private intercourse,
we are told that he was “the kindest and
most generous of patrons, and the most constant
and affectionate friend, rarely changing his officers
or domestics, none leaving, or being deserted
by him, and all receiving in their turn testimonies
of his favour.”</p>

<p>By his hand the revenues of the church were
disbursed in her service and to her honour, and,
to use the words of Lowth, the whole period from
the meridian of life to the end of his days was
employed “in one continued series of generous
actions and great designs, for the good of his
friends, of the poor, and of his country.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">OUR SERMON.</h2>

</div>

<p>In adopting this heading for a series of articles,
which will be continued as occasion offers, we are
very far from intending to startle our readers with
a rush of theological disquisition. In proof of our
sincerity, and as an earnest of the gist of our discourses,
we have chosen as a standing text, or
motto, the golden rule of “peace and goodwill to
all men;” but while we leave intact the functions
of the divine, it is our business, as we conceive it
to be our duty, to sermonize on the morals of
trade, the social relations of every-day life, and
even the proprieties which enhance every species
of domestic enjoyment.</p>

<p>A right understanding of the relative duties of
master and man, or of employer and the employed,
yields to no subject in importance; peculiar
incidents, induced by a rapidly increasing population,
the tendency of commercial wealth to
accumulate in masses, and its employment under
the familiar term “capital,” through the agency
of individuals, in the construction of great works,
constitutes, however, an era in the Building trade
to which former periods bear no very strict analogy.
In offering our humble opinions upon actuating
causes and their effects, be the subject
what it may, we will never lose sight of our text;
we shall make use neither of angry words nor denunciations;
peace is too lovely to our minds, and
charity too imperative to be abandoned; we would
dispel the darker and sterner passions, giving every
brother full credit for good intentions, and assign
occasional deviations from the path of right rather
to misfortune than intention. Whatever the class
of men addressed or dealt with, this, we are convinced,
is the best and only true policy. It may
be very well for any one to talk of their anger
being aroused, or their indignation excited, and
so on, and under such pleas to vent abuse, imprecate
a thousand vengeances, and the like, but, depend
upon it, fear is less to be relied on than love;
we would win a child to our love, not deter it by
frowns and coercion;—we would have a thousand
friends rather than a single enemy.</p>

<p>Who has not heard of the tale of the traveller,
upon whom the sun and wind essayed their power?
These elements, as the fable puts it, were at issue
as to which was superior, and agreed to rest the
decision upon the effect they should produce upon
the first wayfarer. Well, first the wind fell to
work, and blew with all his might, to compel the
subject of their experiment to throw off his cloak,
but the more vehemently the man was assailed,
the closer he wrapped the garment about him; in
turn the sun made trial of his power, and genial
warmth soon accomplished what the bluster of the
ruder element had made more and more difficult.
So in human policy the kindly glow excited by
generous sentiments and actions will succeed
where threats, force, and even punishments have
failed. The human heart has no such obduracies
but that charity will overcome them.</p>

<p>It is a part of our present purpose to refer to
practical benevolence of this nature, and it will be
found in an extract from the <i>Leeds Mercury</i>, given
in another part of our paper, on the subject of the
treatment of workpeople, by Sir John Guest, at
Merthyr Tydvil, and the Messrs. Marshall, of
Leeds. These, thank God, and for the honour of
our country, are not solitary instances. These
gentlemen stand not alone in the practice of that
soundest principle of Christian political economy
which instructs the rich to dispense of their abundance
for the benefit of their poorer brethren. We
have Master Builders in every department, proprietors
of large works and establishments, whose
names we could hold up to the admiration of their
craft and country, but we will not do this violence
to their unobtrusive merit, neither will we invite
invidious comparisons by such selections; we
would rather hold up these Christian duties for
common emulation, and call upon all to “go and
do likewise.”</p>

<p>We open, then, our exhortations to <span class="smcap">Masters</span>,
because we know that the first impulse of benignant
power must originate with <i>them</i>; kindness
from them may be likened to the sun in its influence,
and most surely will it be returned with
usurious interest “into their basket and their
store.”</p>

<p>Who ever saw the good father of a family
putting firm faith in virtue and honour, and regulating
his household by their dictates, failing to
raise up virtuous, amiable, and honourable citizens?
or, to put the case stronger, who ever knew
the man that acted upon opposite principles
succeed in sowing any thing but vice and discord?
Depend upon it, then, the same principles and
rules apply in business, from the overseer of the
smallest undertaking to the governor of a nation.
Fatherly solicitude for those under our care, or
for whom we bear any responsibility, is as solemn
and sacred a duty as the fulfilment of contracts or
engagements; nay, it is the first of duties between
man and man.</p>

<p>On the other hand, as to the workman,—fidelity—and
more, the same generous kindness towards
his master is required, as that he would receive;
in fact, “to do unto others us you would be done
by,” is the great and universal secret of social
happiness.</p>

<p>It is with this view of relative duties that we
deem it of as much importance to engage ourselves
in giving good counsel to our craft, as in
enlightening them on principles of science pertaining
to their several callings; for of what avail
will it be to a man to possess all the knowledge
of his art, if his heart be corrupt, or continue
under vicious influences? Away with, as dross,
all the ability of the engineer, architect, master
builder, or workman, if <i>the man</i> be not endowed
with moral excellence. What are beautiful designs,
imposing structures, mechanical skill, or
ingenious artifice in workmanship, without a
mind and heart in harmony with the superior
inspirations which virtue alone bestows? This,
this indeed must come first as the base of the
pyramid. In any other case the pyramid may be
there, but it topples, leans, or lies on its side; the
same inherent beauty may exist, but its position
and action are superadded elements of deformity.
Oh, how beautiful the human mind when lit up
and guided by the impulses of virtue! how terrible
and loathsome when passion and gaunt
sensuality have their sway!</p>

<p>Guard, my beloved countrymen, against avarice,
envy, malice; avoid contentions; be moderate in
the desire of gain; repine not at another’s success
in life, or the distinctions he may attain to; cast
all rancorous suggestions far from your heart;
contend not in any unholy spirit of craving competition;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
“live, and let live,” is a maxim which
we conjure you at all times to observe.</p>

<p>In times of commercial depression, aggravate
not your own or another’s suffering; these, like
seasons of sickness and malady, must and will have
their recurrences, and they will recur more frequently,
and press more grievously, where brotherly
love and charity, the great preventative and
remedy of human ills, are neglected. Let none
imagine it his privilege to be exempt from these
obligations; let us not, because we see a neighbour
unmindful of his duties in any of the multifarious
walks of life, think ourselves justified in departing
from our superior policy; neither must we judge
and condemn; inflict, if you will, pains and penalties
on yourself, but you have no right to do so on
another.</p>

<p>Pardon us, good brothers of our building fraternity,
and you who do us the favour to lend an
ear to our counsellings, if we thus seek to engage
your attention, and offer our well-meant importunings.
Should your approving suffrages incite
a continuance of our vocation, it will be our ambition
to discuss the relative duties of the stations
you respectively fill—master, apprentice, or workman;
father, brother, son, or husband; neighbour
or friend; and to do as we have now done,
namely, try to improve each and all, and in doing
so, promote, in some degree, the cause of human
happiness.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">TREATMENT OF WORK-PEOPLE BY THEIR EMPLOYERS.</h2>

</div>

<p>In an article under this head it was mentioned
that the parliamentary inquiry into the payment
of wages in goods had shewn, that there are
persons extensively engaged in manufactures of
various kinds, who feel that the employment of
bodies of workpeople involves a degree of responsibility
to care for their general well-being, and
who act on that conviction in a manner highly
creditable to themselves, and conducive to the
excellent object they have in view. These employers
are of opinion that to regard as a machine
a man whose skill or industry assists them to
maintain their own families in respectability, is
altogether unchristian, and that by viewing workpeople
in such a light, they would deprive themselves
of some of the finest opportunities of
usefulness, and of cementing the bonds of society.</p>

<p>Of course, as the intention in moving for a
committee of the House of Commons was to expose
grievances, it was not likely that any examples of
conduct distinguished for its humanity would be
found in the pages of the report. As we remarked,
however, when formerly writing on the
subject, illustrations of this kind might be obtained
by any one from our own neighbourhood. We
had only last week the pleasure of visiting an
extensive range of school buildings just erected on
the best principles, in connection with Messrs.
Marshall’s mill at Holbeck. In that suite of
rooms there are between 300 and 400 children
under daily instruction, independent of about
160 boys, who work half-time at the factory, and
are at school either in the morning or afternoon
of every day; the same gentlemen have also
instituted girls’ and infant schools (which are
situated elsewhere), and a night school, attended
by young men and women from the mill, whose
improvement in conduct as well as attainments, in
consequence of this arrangement, is spoken of
as highly gratifying. In the several schools
every thing seems to be done to promote the
comfort of the young, and to cultivate habits of
cleanliness and decorum, as well as to impart an
excellent plain education.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Plans for affording
the means of recreation to the adult workpeople
have also been devised in connection with these
buildings; and all manifests that a sincere interest
is felt by the members of the firm in the welfare
of every class in their employ.</p>

<p>The principal example of attention to the
interests of workpeople which came under the notice
of the parliamentary committee, was that of Sir
John Guest and Co., at their iron and coal works,
Dowlais. These works, which were established
from thirty to forty years since, “in an isolated
place on the top of a hill,” in Glamorganshire,
have now a town around them (Merthyr Tydvil),
and nearly 5,000 persons are employed by this
firm alone. In the first instance, great difficulty
was experienced by the workpeople in procuring
the means of lodging, but in the course of time
this was removed by the erection of a large number
of cottages at the expense of the company,
and by the people being encouraged to build
dwellings for themselves. The cottages belonging
to the firm are stated to be low-rented, convenient,
well built, well drained, and the taking of
them is quite optional with the workpeople; while
the granting of loans to steady men to build
cottages for themselves has been pursued to a
considerable extent, and has been found to attach
them to the place, to keep them from the ale-house,
and to produce and confirm in them a
feeling of independence.</p>

<p>The amount of each individual’s wages at this
extensive establishment is settled every Friday
evening, and the whole of the hands are paid on
the morning of Saturday; shewing that a large
number of workpeople is no barrier to the early
payment of wages if employers are determined
to adopt that highly beneficial practice.</p>

<p>Nearly twenty-four years ago, Sir John Guest
and his partners recognised the responsibility
which attached to them as employers by erecting
large schools, near the works at Dowlais, chiefly
for the education of the children of their workmen,
but (like Messrs. Marshall) not confined to
them. There are at present about 220 girls and
250 boys under instruction, the children being
admitted at the age of six, and usually remaining
until thirteen years old. The teachers are well
paid, and the whole expenses of the schools are
defrayed by the workpeople and employers together,
in the following manner:—Twopence in
the pound is stopped every week “for the doctor”
from the wages of every one in the works, of
which 1½d. is appropriated to provide medical
attendance for the families of the workmen, and
the remainder goes towards the support of the
schools. Each child is also expected to pay one
penny a week, and whatever is wanting to make
up the amount incurred in maintaining the educational
establishments is contributed by the company.
In connection with the schools, it is worthy
of notice that Mr. Evans, the manager at
Dowlais (from whose evidence our facts are
drawn), expressed before the committee a strong
conviction, as the result both of his own observation
for above twenty years, and of the statements
of colliers themselves, that for a collier
to put his child to work in the pits very young
is decidedly bad economy; instead of gaining, the
family loses by it in the long run, while the unfortunate
victim of error or cupidity becomes
decrepit and unfit for work when individuals of
the same age are in possession of mature strength.
Very few of the children taught in the schools
at Dowlais become colliers, the greater number
being qualified for employment as carpenters,
smiths, and, in some instances, even book-keepers.
“We derive very great advantage,” says
Mr. Evans, “from having children in the works
who have been educated there; they are of great
use to us.” Here, then, is a proof to masters
who have not yet exerted themselves for the
elevation of the families dependent on them, but
are disposed to do so, that such a course is not
only beneficial to others, but brings a reward to
every one who adopts it. The medical attendants
on the workpeople at Dowlais consist
of three regular surgeons and a dispenser, whose
services are remunerated chiefly by the money
stopped from the wages. In 1827 a fund for the
relief of the sick and aged was formed, one penny
in the pound being stopped every week to
furnish the necessary supply for the wants of
those who are thus unable to provide for themselves;
this fund is at the disposal of a committee,
elected yearly by all the contributors.</p>

<p>From the peculiar circumstances of the district,
when the works of Sir John Guest and Co. were
established, and for many years after, it was desirable
and even needful that the firm should afford
their workpeople the means of obtaining the
necessaries of life by maintaining a shop on the
premises. In 1823, however, they closed it, but
once again opened it at the request of the men in
1828. On the act against truck shops being
passed in 1831, the workmen were called together
and desired to state whether they wished the store
belonging to the firm still to be continued. The
votes were taken by ballot, and thirteen only were
given for the discontinuance; but as there was
not perfect unanimity, the company thought it
best that the shop should be finally closed at that
time; and the increase of population having had
the usual effect of attracting private individuals to
supply the wants of the community, the only result
of this step was to shut up an establishment
where the labouring classes were always sure of
buying good articles at a moderate price. The
accommodation being no longer necessary, we
think the company’s decision was a wise one.</p>

<p>It is gratifying to find that no loss whatever has
been entailed on Sir John Guest and Co. by all
the beneficial regulations adopted by them on behalf
of their workpeople. On the contrary, “by
the education of the people,” Mr. Evans states,
“we have gained more than we have spent upon
them.” And this gentleman expressed himself as
feeling certain that if a similar system were extended
over the manufacturing and mining districts
of the whole country, it would prove the
cheapest and most effectual mode of benefiting
both the working classes and employers, and consequently
society at large. Of course, the details
of the system at Dowlais, or at any other establishment
of which an account is before the public,
are not essential to its being adopted with advantage
in other parts of the country, though the
success which has attended those plans gives them
a title to careful consideration; the thing to be desired
is, that each employer should ask himself
how far he can adopt the principle, and then carry
into operation the dictates of his own judgment
and conscience.—Leeds Mercury.</p>

</div>

<p class="hanging2"><i>Temples, Ancient and Modern, or Notes on Church
Architecture.</i> By <span class="smcap">William Bardwell</span>, Architect.
London: Fraser &amp; Co., and Williams.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Bardwell</span>, in the Preface to this work,
states his object to be—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To endeavour to excite among architects a spirit of
inquiry such as cannot fail to prevent a repetition of
those improprieties the existence of which in our public
edifices has so long afforded subject for complaint and
matter for criticism;” and “to put an end to that inconsistency
which is the cause of error,—namely, the tyranny
of custom and the caprice of fashion: which, while they
compel the modern architect to copy <i>in little</i> and with
meaner materials the sublime works of revered antiquity,
indulge a laugh at his expense, because his reproduction
fails to excite those sensations of pleasure and admiration
which are inseparable from a contemplation of the
original.”</p>

</div>

<p>Passing over the first three chapters of the
work, which, although they contain much excellent
matter of opinion, to which all may subscribe,
do nevertheless open a door to controversy, and
this it is our desire to avoid,—we come to
Chapter IV. This is headed “<i>Errors in the details
of late-erected Churches, a connected series of
critical observations</i>;” and has for its object, by
stringing together a number of critiques from the
<i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> and other sources, to call
attention to the prevalent errors of past design,
and to enunciate correct principles for future
practice. We quite agree with Mr. Bardwell,
that “notwithstanding the querulous tone in
which the writers have occasionally indulged, the
extracts contain many hints that may be permanently
useful;” and would wish that the spirit of
a following paragraph could be always borne in
mind by the critic and reviewer. “The legitimate
object of criticism,” says our author, “is to
improve the future, rather than to cast ill-natured
censure upon the past.” However, we cannot
take exception to Mr. Bardwell’s discharge of his
duty. He has most appositely given these extracts
through a whole chapter, and placed them
in admirable order for study and profitable reflection.
No one can read through this chapter attentively
without being impressed with a desire
to contribute his part to the rectification of such
errors as are therein pointed out—it will awaken
many to an active investigation where other
modes of expression or remonstrance would probably
fail.</p>

<p>In Chapter V. Mr. Bardwell enters into the
great question that awaits us at every approach to
a comprehensive study in architecture—<span class="smcap">the
origin</span>. Speculation on this point is in its nature
endless; but it is highly gratifying to feel occasionally
that we are thrown in the way of facts,
and such it is the province of this chapter to treat
us to. With a little prefatory matter in the way
of an assault upon the hitherto deemed orthodox
authorities on such subjects, and upon the principle
of adherence to rule and precedent, and upon
the little fables of an inventive tradition, assigning
to this accident or that the origin of this or that
feature, plan, and style, we come to the “burden
of the book,”—<span class="smcap">Temples</span>; and have a most
interesting dissertation on those of ancient character,
or on what we may more aptly term sacred
edifices, memorials, or monuments.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“An altar of turf or of stones, <i>stones of memorial</i>, such
as that set up at the grave of Jacob’s beloved Rachel, the
<i>great stone</i> near the oak at Shechem, Absalom’s Pillar,
Jacob’s Bethel, <span class="smcap">Samuel</span>’s Ebenezer, the Gilgal, or
circle of stones, of <span class="smcap">Joshua</span>; a heap of unhewn stones,
the Pandoo Koolies, of Hindostan, the numerous pillars
set up by the Phœnician merchants, on the shores of the
Mediterranean, in France, in Sweden; and in Great
Britain, circles and rows of huge stones, like those of
Stonehenge, Abury, &amp;c.; cromlechs and logan stones, a
portable ark, or tabernacle, were the first sacred monuments.
Next came the pyramid, a cylinder, whether a
<i>cippus</i> or a column; a cubical block, with a particular
member superadded to the regularity of mathematical
proportions. A sphere and a <i>tetrahedron</i>; and last succeeded
a vase covered with a flat lid, and adorned with
various sculptures from the vegetable and marine world.”</p>

</div>

<p>Thus Mr. Bardwell connects with religion the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
first memorable and permanent efforts of Building
Art—sacrifice he shows to have been associated
with, and to have guided the workings of,
the first builders, from the “primeval altar of
little more than a raised hearth, built generally
of unhewn stones,” to the “column or stone pillar
of <i>mystic</i> character—‘And <span class="smcap">Jacob</span> rose up early
in the morning, and took the stone that he had
put for his pillow, and set it up for a <i>pillar</i>, and
poured oil upon the top of it; and he called the
name of that place Beth-El.’” “The Greeks also
erected pillars which they called ‘<i>Baitulia</i>,’ evidently
derived from Beth-El, involving the same
mystery, and both supposed to be symbols of <i>the
Divine Presence</i>.”</p>

<p>Chapter VI. increases in interest, and is devoted
to the <span class="smcap">Temple of Ammon</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Temple of Ammon, the remains of which archæologists,
for many powerful reasons, agree are extant in
the enormous pile known as the Temple of Karnac, is by
far the most extensive, as well as the most ancient, of the
Theban edifices; properly belonging to the whole period
of the monarchy, and may with propriety be termed the
<i>Temple of the Pharaohs</i>, the majority of whom, in succession,
more particularly such as are celebrated in history,
contributed their efforts to its enlargement and magnificence.
From numerous authorities it seems clear that
<span class="smcap">Ham</span>, the son of <span class="smcap">Noah</span>, the <span class="smcap">Amun</span>, <span class="smcap">Ammon</span>, or
<span class="smcap">Osiris</span> of the Egyptians, must be considered as the
original founder of Thebes, or the city of Ammon, as his
son <span class="smcap">Mizraim</span>, <span class="smcap">Misor</span>, or <span class="smcap">Menes</span>, was by common consent
the founder of Memphis; so that the temple of Ammon
or Ham was, in all probability, originally named
from its founder, like the Temple of Solomon at Jerusalem.”</p>

</div>

<p>We cannot take our readers along with us as
we would by quoting largely from this interesting
chapter, nor will we presume to dispose of the
work by this brief and imperfect notice; it deserves
much more at our hands; it is written with
an enlarged feeling, and a genuine spirit of devotion
to the sublime art upon which it treats; it is
erudite, and occasionally profound; but we must
take our leave of it for the present, concluding
with another extract from the same chapter.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The remains of Karnac are about 2,500 feet from the
banks of the Nile, on an artificial elevation, surrounded
by a brick wall, about 6,300 yards in circuit. The chief
front of the temple (the western) is turned towards the
river, with which it was connected by an alley of colossal
crio-sphinxes, leading down to the bank of the river.
Here the devotee would land who came from a distance
to the shrine of Ammon, and with amazement and a feeling
of religious awe would he slowly walk along between
the majestic and tranquil sphinxes to the still more magnificent
propylæ of the building. This colossal entrance
is about 360 feet long and 148 high; the great door in
the middle is 64 feet high. Passing through this door-way,
he would enter a long court, occupied by a row of
pillars on the north and south sides, and a double row of
taller pillars running down the middle. These pillars terminated
opposite to two colossal statues in front of a second
propylon, through which, after ascending a flight o’
twenty-seven steps, we enter the great hypostyle hall,
which had a flat stone roof, supported by one hundred
and thirty-four colossal pillars, some of which are
twenty-six feet in circumference, and others thirty-four.
The width of this magnificent hall (for the entrance is in
the centre of the longest side) is about 338 feet, and the
length or depth 170 feet. The centre column supported a
clere-story, in which were small windows. Four beautiful
obelisks mark the entrance to the adytum, which consists
of three apartments entirely of granite. The centre
or principal room is 20 feet long, 16 wide, and 13 feet
high. Three blocks of granite form the roof, which is
painted with clusters of gilt stars on a blue ground.
Beyond this are other porticos and galleries, which have
been continued to another propylon at the distance of
2,000 feet from that at the western extremity of the
temple.”</p>

2s. 6d.</p>

<p>We had commenced the selection of a list of
patents from this excellent compendium, with the
intention of laying before our readers all those
pertaining to the Building Art, but found that we
should have to reprint nearly the whole of the
book; so comprehensive is the range we have
chosen, and so ingenious the class we have the
honour to serve. Of 441 patents herein entered,
by far the largest proportion are as we have stated;
and we can only, therefore, refer to the work itself.
Besides the above list of patents, there is
appended a copy of Letters Patent, an abstract of
the Registration of Designs Act, and a notice respecting
its operation, concluding with a useful
Index, which shews at one glance what you would
refer to. The value of such a work as this is not
to be estimated. All persons intending to take
out patents should look over its pages, as it may
save much trouble and expense. We know of
many who would have been great gainers had they
had such a guide at their elbows.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">MISCELLANEOUS.</h2>

</div>

<p>There is a consideration which entitles architecture
to a decided pre-eminence amongst the
other arts. It is itself the parent of many separate
professions, and requires a combination of
talents and an extent of knowledge for which
other professions have not the smallest occasion.
An acquaintance with the sciences of geometry
and mechanical philosophy, with the arts of sculpture
and design, and other abstruse and elegant
branches of knowledge, are indispensable requisites
in the education of a good architect, and
raise his art to a vast height above those professions
which practice alone can render familiar,
and which consist in the mere exertion of muscular
force. From these considerations it appears there
is some foundation in the very nature of architecture
for those extraordinary privileges to which
masons have always laid claim, and which they
have almost always possessed—privileges which
no other artists could have confidence to ask, or
liberty to enjoy.—<i>Ency. Brit., Vol. XIV., p. 280.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alison on French Architecture.</span>—In
France we find that public works have been
reared at an expense not exceeding that of edifices
of little or no excellence in our own country,
even although the charges of building are not
materially different in the two countries. So true
it is, that the most essential elements in architectural
beauty—genius and taste in the architect,
are beyond the power of mere wealth to command—that
it is not money to construct beautiful
edifices, but the mind to conceive them, which
is generally wanting. It would seem, therefore,
that it is the pure taste and noble conceptions of
the artists of Southern Europe, rather than in any
great excellence in the materials at their command,
or the wealth of which they have the disposal,
to which we must ascribe their remarkable
superiority to those of this country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Devonshire House, Piccadilly.</span>—The additions
and alterations which are being made to
this fine old mansion, the residence of His Grace
the Duke of Devonshire, are proceeding rapidly,
and will add considerably to the extent as well as
to its internal arrangements. Mr. Decimus Burton
is the architect, and Messrs. Woolcott and
Son are the contractors, for these works, which
will yet take many months to complete. The
Duke is for the present staying at his princely
abode, Chatsworth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Church Extension.</span>—There are now twelve
new churches building, or about to be commenced,
in various parts of the metropolis; one in the
Kent-road, in the parish of St. George, Southwark;
one in the parish of Paddington; another on
the site of the Old Broadway Chapel, Westminster;
a large church, with a lofty Gothic
tower, in which a musical peal of bells is to be
placed, in Wilton-square, Knightsbridge; three
in Bethnal-green parish, and a church in St.
Pancras parish. Sites have been chosen for a
new church in the Waterloo-road district of Lambeth
parish; another in St. Botolph Without,
Aldgate, in the county of Middlesex; and a third
in St. George’s-in-the-East. The new parish
church of St. Giles’s, Camberwell, building on the
site of the old edifice, which was destroyed by fire,
is progressing rapidly, and will be a noble and
spacious edifice. The new church at Paddington
will be a great ornament to that neighbourhood.
The University of Durham has granted 400<i>l.</i>
towards the erection of a new church at South
Shields. It is intended to build a new Roman Catholic
Church in the eastern part of the metropolis.
The site chosen is a large piece of ground on the
south side of the Commercial-road, and it is
expected that the total cost of the edifice and the
purchase of the ground will not fall short of
30,000<i>l.</i></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">NOTICES.</h2>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">To Advertisers.</span>—<i>This first impression of Five
Thousand is reserved for sale in London and the large
Provincial Towns. The next impression of five thousand
will be stamped, so as to pass post-free, and will
be circulated gratuitously on the 7th of January,
1843, amongst that number of the nobility, gentry,
clergy, professional men, and principal tradesmen, all
over the United Kingdom, according to a list which
has most generously been placed at our disposal for
that purpose by a friend. It is important, therefore,
to advertisers that they should seize the opportunity
thus afforded them of a special and select notification
of their business among a class of such importance.
It may be affirmed, indeed, that a circulation of this
character and amount is superior to one of four times
the number of copies dispersed at random, in the ordinary
way of sale. Additional advertisements, therefore
(if sufficient in number) will be inserted in a
Supplement to accompany this gratuitous circulation,
as well as the future sale, and should be sent to the
Office at latest, on Thursday, the 5th of January. The
charge for advertisements in the Supplement will be
15s. per quarter column, 1l. 10s. per half column,
and so on; smaller advertisements according to agreement.
To insure more attention to the Supplement,
as well as to secure an additional circulation for it,
it will contain matter of interest as to the progress of
the first impression, correspondence, and the like.
Our prospects hitherto have been so far gratifying as
to give us confidence that the whole number of
20,000 copies of the Precursor will be disposed of!</i></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">To our Readers.</span>—<i>As we do not choose to trust
our own judgment on a subject in which so many are
interested besides ourselves, and as it is so easy to
obtain an opinion by which we may be guided, we
think it right in this place to invite attention to our
views on the subject of the future character of “<span class="smcap">The
Builder</span>.” Before a month shall have elapsed, at
least 20,000 numbers of this paper will, in all probability,
have been circulated, and will have passed under
the review of twenty times that number of readers.
They, and in particular our Building friends, will
have made up their minds as to whether “<span class="smcap">The
Builder</span>” is a work to be encouraged—it certainly
is not our desire to attempt to force the point, although
we would use a little “gentle violence” to develope the
evidence—and this we may be supposed to be doing
now. We have said that there are two parties to this,
as to every other question—the public and ourselves.
It is not for us to tell the public that they know nothing
of their own wants, and to attempt to force them into
the belief that such a paper as “<span class="smcap">The Builder</span>” is
absolutely necessary, but unless we had taken this step
on our own responsibility, the question would have
remained undetermined. What we would ask of the
Building public then is—Do you wish to have a periodical
devoted to your interests, as we propose? and
whether would you have it a Magazine and Advertiser
simply, or as a Newspaper conjoined? In the former
case it might be weekly or monthly, in the latter it
must necessarily be weekly. As to the price and size:
If a Magazine and Advertiser of twelve pages of the
size of our present number, we should say 3d. the
number, stamped 4d.; if a Newspaper of sixteen
pages, we do not think it could be less than 6d. Every
body has seen the</i> Illustrated London News, <i>and allowing
for difference in the character of the illustrations
(those in “<span class="smcap">The Builder</span>” being devoted entirely to
art and science), you will be able to judge of the
appearance which the latter will present. We are
only anxious to undertake no more, or, no less,
than can reasonably be expected to be carried out. If
it should appear from experience of the working that
more can be accomplished, we shall most gladly acknowledge
and act upon it, by either enlarging the
paper, or reducing the price. But we still think that
to conjoin the character of a Magazine and Newspaper,
and at the cost of one to give the advantages of both,
will be to study the true economy of our cause.</i></p>

<p><i>The readers, therefore, have much of the settlement
of the question in their own hands—even to the influencing
of the advertisers. All advertisers look for
papers of large circulation, and as advertisements are
a great means of support to a newspaper, it is evident
that the more “<span class="smcap">The Builder</span>” is supported by the
mere reader, by so much the more does it stand a
chance of support from advertisers. We venture,
therefore, to speak in this business as though we were
ourselves less concerned in its issue than we really
feel to be—and we urge upon our honoured fellow-craftsmen
to make this paper their own. Let it be a
sign or standard of union.</i></p>

<p><i>We do not ask to have subscriptions forwarded,
but we would respectfully request to be favoured by
an immediate intimation front all parties as to their
willingness to subscribe, and which they would prefer,
a Magazine alone, or Magazine and Newspaper.</i></p>

<p><i>We trust it will be considered that we are pursuing
a straightforward and ingenuous course, willing to be
guided by circumstances, rather than to seek to force
or control them, or to stake upon our own presumptuous
judgment that which a prudent and discreet man
would say should be left to the decision of the common
voice and experience.</i></p>

<p><i>Pardon us if we once more urge you to rally round
“<span class="smcap">The Builder</span>.”</i></p>

<p class="dropcap">BUILDERS’ COLLEGE, LONDON.—To
PARENTS AND GUARDIANS.—Mr. HANSOM,
Architect of the Birmingham Town Hall, &amp;c. &amp;c.,
has associated with his practice an Institution to give
enlarged facilities to students in Architecture and Architectural
Engineering; and to form a superior class of
Architectural Sculptors, Carvers, Modellers, &amp;c., to be
engaged in his own office and works until competent to
practise a liberal and lucrative profession.</p>

<p>It has been Mr. Hansom’s study to lay down a plan for
the instruction of architectural decorators and furnishers,
which shall combine the advantages of the school, the
office, and the workshop; so that general education, professional
training, and handicraft skill may be acquired
and perfected together—that the benefits of college discipline,
and residence of systematic tuition under proficient
masters, of lectures and examinations, and of constant
familiarity with books, models, and works may be united
in one establishment.</p>

<p>Pupils are eligible at the age of fourteen and upwards,
and are articled in the usual manner as apprentices. The
terms are moderate, and with other particulars, may be
known on application at the office, 27, Foley-place,
London.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The importance of a system of education as above proposed,
it is scarcely necessary to point out. While other
callings and professions are crowded, those to which this
Institution principally refers are but rarely, and in many
instances, imperfectly practised, and the demand for proficients
is every day wonderfully on the increase. In
proof of this, we need only to advert to the evidences of
the growing public taste, and to note the tone and temper
of the professors and patrons of architecture. Witness
also the ornamented character of our public and
private edifices, the restoration of ecclesiastical structures,
and the building of new ones, on a munificent
scale; the late fearful ravages of fire, causing the necessity
of a large amount of rebuilding, and leading, most
probably, to the remodelling of most of the large cities
of Europe. All these circumstances tell how important
it is that a school should be founded, and a body of professors
formed to fill up the vacuity in that section of art
which lies between the mere constructor of buildings,
and the architect and engineer who gives the plan of the
structure.</p>

<p>In fact, it is only in obedience to that law of general
movement which characterizes these times, that the institution
in question has had its birth—the universal
voice calls for advance—the arts of design are to be revived,
and the debasement of centuries cast off. Schools
are being established under government patronage, and
mechanics’ institutes were but a phase of progress—the
thirst for knowledge has been stimulated, but not gratified.
There remains, then, to be formed an institution wherein
the theory and practice of art may accompany each other;
and this is proposed by the Builders’ College.</p>

<p>Thus, while the pupil will be made familiar with the
best examples of ancient and modern decoration by
means of books, drawings, models, and the inspection
of buildings; while he will be instructed in the principles
of design, and in the science of construction upon which
they depend; while he will be made a skilful draughtsman
and colourist, he will be trained in the handicraft
arts, so as to be able to produce the works themselves,
the objects of his study and investigation.</p>

<p>But in addition to all this, it is necessary that he learn
so much of practical mechanics, mathematics, and of experimental
and natural philosophy, as to be guided in his
art by the <i>rationale</i> which these supply. Mechanical laws
and mechanical powers have a wide range of influence in
the arts of design; for how shall a man embellish his work
appropriately who knows not the former, or how economize
in the use and application of machinery, without
being conversant with the latter? Mathematical science,
in particular as to the properties of figures and of numbers,
is essential to him—and as to sound, light, and heat—as
to the ventilation of buildings, supply of water, and
drainage—as to chemical constituents and processes
affecting the preparation, combination, and preservation
of his materials—as to the natural fitness of metals and
minerals, of vegetable and even animal products to be
used in building—as to the vast suggestive sources of construction
and of ornament that exist in the whole arcanum
of nature—how, in all these respects, shall the pupil make
efficient or rational progress; or how acquire a mastery of
his art, unless he study and be made acquainted with the
sciences and laws that bear upon and illustrate its several
elements?</p>

<p>History, and, indeed, general literature, as bearing
upon the subject of his inquiries, will demand a share of
his attention. It is not, however, to be supposed that
the pupil can be critically or curiously learned in all these,
nor, on the other hand, that a superficial knowledge will
avail; but it is considered that by confining attention to
the matter of each that strictly pertains to architecture,
and by combining as far as possible, in one establishment,
the means of pursuing an unbroken scheme of instruction,
that the evils of a too general and desultory system
of study, and of widely-scattered sources of information,
will be largely remedied.</p>

<p>The bringing together of a number of youths and their
associate teachers, probably from all quarters of the
world (as already promises to be the case); the contact of
various minds, influenced by various national peculiarities,
but all bent upon one comprehensive enterprise of attainment;
the working together in the various practical development
of progress, under practical instructors, and
for practical and intelligible ends—these, and a number of
other circumstances of a favouring character, must conduce
to a rapid progress and an extensive and sound proficiency.</p>

<p>And not least in the assumed merits of this Institution
are the features pertaining to ordinary or general school
education; the neglect of early youth may be repaired
here, or the acquirements of that period secured, and
directed to practical purposes; arithmetic, mensuration,
book-keeping, classic literature, and the French, German,
and Italian languages, which are almost essential to the
education of an artist, will be taught in their due routine,
and the facility for acquiring them considerably enlarged
by association with students and tutors speaking the respective
languages of their own countries.</p>

<p>By uniting, therefore, the pursuit of knowledge to a
strict system of supervision and instruction—of regular
and fixed hours of employment and recreation, and of constant
practical tendencies, engaging the students in the
designing, fabricating, and applying objects of art, confiding
to them at proper opportunities and periods the superintendence
of works and workmen, and giving them at
the same time the benefits of social converse with their
fellows and tutors, whether in study, work, recreation, or
refection; paying a strict attention to their morals,
habits, and health; in fine, by aiming at the best practical
union of the home, the school, the workshop, and
the studio, it is hoped that a fine class of men may be
produced, fitted to the exigencies of the times, and calculated
to advance the arts, and do honour to their country.
Neither is this attempt so novel or so extraordinary as it
may seem; the history of art in former times, and the
practice of contemporary professors abroad, give sanction
to the scheme. It is not with every man a gift or a passion
to apply himself to teaching in conjunction with the
practice of his art, but some of the greatest names of antiquity
and of this present age are associated with
schools and styles, and indeed it is an important question
to be put, as to whether the business of education, paramount
as it is above all other business, should not be conducted
by and confided to practical men.</p>

<p>Let the groundwork be well laid in the minds of the
ardent and generous of our young countrymen. Let their
ambition to excel be honestly encouraged and directed.
Open to them the pages of past history, as to the glorious
and sublime achievements of the architects and associate
artists of old, and point out to them the path of equal, or
it may be greater distinction (for who shall say what mechanical
and chemical science, allied to the inspiration of
genius, may produce); and we shall no more hear of the
complaints of inferiority, or of the want of original talent
in the Fine Arts among our countrymen.</p>

<p>It may be urged by many that this is a gigantic work,
and should be left to the government, or a company. A
moment’s reflection, however, will check the thought of
the former in an English breast, and the interference
of companies with objects of private enterprize, is, perhaps,
as much to be deprecated. That this is a legitimate
object of private enterprize, may be inferred from
what has been already said as to ancient and contemporary
practice. And in a matter where so much depends
upon the bias of the heart—where fatherly care, as much
as artistic sentiment is needed, to guide and form the
student—where every interest of the superior is bound up
with that of the pupil, associating the success of the
former in his practice, with the probity and proficiency
of the latter—where an intelligent conception of interest
and duty reigns in the mind of the principal—these, it
is presumed, offer the strongest guarantees of success,
when other arrangements, through companies or co-partnerships,
under boards of directors and managers,
would be likely to fail.</p>

<p>All that can be done in this respect has probably been
done in the London University and King’s College, by
appointing professors, instituting classes, and giving a
course of lectures in Architecture and Engineering; or
by taking the matter a step further as is being tried at
the College of Civil Engineers, Putney. The rest must
be accomplished in the office or the atelier of the professor,
and in works and buildings conducted by him.
The pupil in this case takes part in practical operations
with an intelligible aim, and a tangible end. He is identified
with, or interested in, their progress, and imbibes
knowledge of a most profitable kind through grateful
and agreeable channels.</p>

<p class="dropcap">ENGLISH PATENTS; being a Register of
all those granted for Inventions in the Arts, Manufactures,
Chemistry, Agriculture, &amp;c. With copious Index.</p>

<p class="center">By ANDREW PRITCHARD, M.R.I.</p>

<p>This Annual contains a register of all the patents granted in
each year; the title, date, and name of inventor; distinguishing
those produced in foreign countries from those native.
Alphabetical lists both of names and subjects being given, an easy
reference is obtained.</p>

<p>To the manufacturer the importance of this work must be at
once apparent, as it embraces improvements in nearly every
branch of art and science, and enables him to ascertain what processes
and articles he is restricted from using or making, and the
period when they become public property. To inventors, many
are the uses for which a list of this kind is available: besides
offering them a ready means of ascertaining whether others have
directed their attention to the same subjects, it enables them, if
such be the case, to determine whether the inventions are similar,
or what parts are claimed by former patentees, and whether they
can secure their invention to themselves without infringement of
an existing patent.</p>

<p>To each annual list is appended some valuable information relating
to subjects connected with inventions. The “English
Patents,” 1841, has appended a copy of letters patent as now
granted in England, by which inventors are enabled to form some
idea of the rights and privileges they acquire by a patent. Also
an abstract of the consolidated act, which commenced its operation
in September, 1842, whereby inventors or manufacturers may
secure to themselves the sole right of making and selling, for
terms not exceeding three years, any new design on articles of
manufacture, or for any novelty in the pattern, shape, configuration,
or ornament thereof. The orders of the Lords of the Treasury
respecting the charges to be made for such registrations, the
names of articles registered, &amp;c. are given.</p>

<p>The “English Patents” granted in 1842 will contain, in addition
to the List and Index, some observations on foreign patents,
which, it is conceived, will be useful to inventors generally, but
more especially to those who have obtained English patents.</p>

<p>This Annual will be published as soon after the close of each
year as the collecting, arranging, and printing the work will permit.</p>

SHRUBS; being the Arboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum
abridged, for the use of Nurserymen, Gardeners, and
Foresters.</p>

<p class="center">The abridgment of the Arboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum
contains:—</p>

<p>1. Characters and short popular descriptions of all the species
and varieties of hardy trees and shrubs now in British gardens,
with directions for their culture; including the soil most suitable
for them, their propagation, and their uses in the arts, and more
especially in landscape-gardening and profitable planting.</p>

<p>2. Engravings of all the species which are described, to one
and the same scale, of which a figure, 1, a beautiful new species
of Cytisus (Cytisus Weldenii), and fig. 2, a species of pine from
Mexico (Pinus Teocotes), are here given as specimens.</p>

<p>3. The scientific names and scientific synonymes of all the species,
and their popular names in the languages of the different
countries where they are indigenous or cultivated.</p>

<p>4. An alphabetical index to all the species and varieties, with
their synonymes.</p>

<p>5. A tabular analysis of the leaves, by which the name of any
species of tree or shrub described in the work may, in general, be
discovered, from a small portion of a shoot with the leaves on.</p>

<p>6. Specific characters, descriptions, and figures of some species,
more particularly of pines, firs, and oaks, which were not in the
country in 1838, when the large work was completed.</p>

<p>7. An analysis of the commoner trees and shrubs of Britain,
with reference to their uses in plantations, useful or ornamental,
their adaptation for particular soils and situations, their flowers
and time of flowering, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>In a word, though this abridgment does not include all the
interesting and useful information on the natural history of trees
which will be found in the larger work, or any of the portraits of
entire trees which constitute so distinguished a feature in it, yet
it contains all that is necessary to enable the reader to discover
the names of the different species, and to ascertain their culture,
propagation, and uses in Britain; in short, all that is essential
for the nurseryman, gardener, and forester.</p>

<p class="center">The ARBORETUM FRUTICETUM et
BRITANNICUM;</p>

<p class="center">In 8 vols.: four of letter-press, illustrated by above 2500 engravings,
and four of octavo and quarto plates.</p>

<p>This work is in three divisions:—</p>

<p>I. The history of the introduction of trees and shrubs into Britain,
and the history and geography of the trees and shrubs of
temperate climates throughout the world; shewing the trees and
shrubs which are already in the country, and those which yet remain
to be introduced. This occupies 250 pages of vol. I.</p>

<p>II. A description of all the trees and shrubs, hardy and half-hardy,
cultivated in Britain; in which is given their history, geography,
uses, propagation, culture, diseases, insects, mosses,
lichens, fungi, &amp;c., occupying the remaining part of vol. I. and
the whole of vols. II., III., and IV.</p>

<p>III. Portraits of trees of from ten to twelve years’ growth, of
which the accompanying figure of the Chilian pine (Araucaria
imbricata) may serve as a specimen, growing within ten miles of
London, all drawn to the same scale of one inch to four feet, and
accompanied by botanical specimens of their winter’s wood,
leaves, flowers, and fruit, all drawn to the scale of one-sixth of an
inch to a foot. Besides the young trees, there are portraits of
full-grown trees of all the more important species, in order to
shew the character which they assume when of mature age. Some
of these are drawn in foliage, of which a figure of the Cyprus of
Mistra, the largest cyprus in the world, is given as a specimen;
and others, taken in winter, when divested of their foliage, of
which the accompanying figure of the common Beech (Fagus
sylvatica) is an illustration. These are drawn to a scale of
one inch to twelve feet. This mode of giving portraits of trees
and botanical specimens to a fixed scale, has been adopted in
“The Arboretum Britannicum” for the first time, and it gives
that work a decided superiority over all previous publications on
the same subject. This division of the work occupies vols. V.,
VI., VII., and VIII.</p>

<p>The first four volumes of “The Arboretum” are illustrated
with upwards of 2500 engravings, chiefly of botanical specimens,
but including also insects, fungi, engravings of the leaves of the
natural size of all the species of several genera, portraits of remarkable
trees or shrubs (such as Johnson’s willow, the cypress of
Soma, &amp;c.); nearly fifty remarkable oaks, above ten remarkable
yew trees, the king and queen beeches at Ashridge, and many
other remarkable beech trees, remarkable elms, ashes, poplars,
pines, firs, &amp;c. &amp;c.; portraits, taken during winter, to shew the
effect of the different deciduous trees at that season; landscapes,
exhibiting the effect of the particular kinds of trees, when employed
by the landscape-gardener, in combination with other
trees, or with buildings; ground-plans, shewing the mode of laying
out and planting arboretums, fruticetums, cricacetums, rosariums,
&amp;c.; diagrams, shewing trellises and other structures for
training climbing shrubs, the mode of forming fences of particular
shrubs, of making baskets, &amp;c., of willow-rods, of forming
surface drains for arboretums, of sawing up timber for sale, as
practised in Norway, &amp;c. &amp;c. In short, the work embraces every
part of the subject of the study of the hardy trees and shrubs of
Britain.</p>

<p class="dropcap">KEENE’S PATENT MARBLE CEMENT.—This
cement, which exceeds every other in hardness,
is intended for interior uses, where strength and despatch in
execution are required. From the smoothness of its surface, it
is an advantageous substitute for wood in its application to
skirtings, architrave, mouldings, &amp;c., as it resists the action of
fire, and keeps back vermin.</p>

<p>The coarse qualities form a paving not distinguishable from
stone in colour and hardness, but of one-third the price. The
best white quality takes a brilliant polish, and the scagliola made
from this cement has a peculiar richness of colouring. The imitations
produced in it of Florentine and other Mosaics, encaustic
tiles, &amp;c., for ornamental paving, are unequalled in their effect
and moderate cost.</p>

<p>Keene’s Cement has been applied with success for the altars of
Catholic and other churches, both in England and Ireland; and
to its use in the royal palaces and government buildings, besides
numerous and private works, the patentees can refer with confidence.</p>

<p>The public is respectfully informed that the Proprietors of the
Westminster Marble Factory have made considerably more extensive
and most important improvements in the Working and
Polishing Marble by Steam Power at the above Factory, so that
every variety of Marble Work is executed in a superior style,
hitherto unprecedented in this country, and at such reduced
prices as greatly facilitate its use in the decoration of public and
private buildings for the following useful and ornamental purposes:—</p>

<p>Marble Staircases, Door Jambs, Linings for Rooms, Columns,
Chimney Pieces, Wash-hand Tables, Monuments, Tablets, Mortars,
Tombs, Door-plates, Baths, Pavements, Slabs for Dairies, &amp;c.</p>

<p>They respectfully solicit a trial from those whose consumption
is considerable, as they will realize an immense saving by forwarding
their orders to this Establishment. Much attention
will be devoted to the interests of Architects, Builders, and
Cabinet Makers, to execute their orders in a style entirely unequalled.
An unabated zeal will be maintained to continue the
patronage so liberally bestowed by men of business.</p>

<p>Caution.—It having been recently discovered that orders intended
for this Company have been surreptitiously obtained, and
executed by others at a higher price than they charge, it is particularly
requested that future orders be addressed to the Westminster
Marble Company’s Factory, Earl-street, Horseferry-road,
Millbank, Westminster.</p>

EVERY GENUINE PEN, and Vendors are desired to note
that his Cards of Pens are made up in Packets of One Dozen
each, and have a label outside, with a fac-simile of his Signature.</p>

<p>The Genuine GILLOTT’S PENS may usually be obtained at the regular

frequently palmed upon the Public as the real GILLOTT’S PENS.</p>

attempt to impose their pernicious compounds upon the public as the
real “MACASSAR OIL” for the Hair, and “KALYDOR” for the Complexion;
they copy the bills and labels of the original articles, substituting
either a <span class="smcap">fictitious name</span> or the word “GENUINE” in the place of
“ROWLAND’S.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">THE PATENT RAMONEUR<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> ASSOCIATION,
FOR PROMOTING THE SWEEPING OF
CHIMNEYS BY MACHINERY.—CENTRAL OFFICE, 34,
FOLEY-PLACE, PORTLAND-PLACE.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> From the French verb “Ramoner,” to sweep.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In consequence of an Act passed August 7, 1840, intituled,
“An Act for the Regulation of Chimney-sweepers and Chimneys,”
by which it is enacted, “That from and after the first of July,
1842, any person who shall compel or knowingly allow any child
or young person, under the age of twenty-one years, to ascend or
descend a chimney or enter a flue for the purpose of sweeping,
cleaning, or coring the same, or for extinguishing a fire therein,
shall be liable to a penalty of not more than ten pounds, or less
than five pounds,”—all chimneys from henceforth must be
cleaned and swept by machinery.</p>

<p>This Association of gentlemen has its origin in an earnest
desire to promote a cause which has long occupied the attention
of the warmest friends of humanity, and to give decided and
practical effect to the provisions of the above-mentioned Act of
Parliament.</p>

<p>In responding to the call of humanity, by the entire abolition
of the unseemly and afflicting practice of cleansing chimneys by
the direct agency of the Living Infant Sweeper, the authority of
the Legislature has been exercised to confer a public benefit, in
the abatement of an evil of great magnitude, and a fruitful
source of lasting misery. It only remains that the detail of minor
arrangements be carried out in the way that may seem the best
adapted to perfecting the working of the Act, and accomplish the
requisite changes, consistently with the public sense of fitness
and propriety.</p>

<p>This Association, therefore, brings before the country an efficacious
means of obviating, for the future, the necessity or any approach
to the evils of the old system, in accordance with the
general feeling and opinion on the subject, and in strict and active
furtherance of the law as it now stands.</p>

<p>The considerations which the Association desire to lay before
the public arrange themselves under the following general
heads:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">The well-known and acknowledged difficulty and danger of
the old process, and the dangerous exposure and risk to
property, in large masses, from the imperfect performance
of former methods.</p>

<p class="hanging">The harsh, not to say hard and cruel, treatment of the infant
sweeper, from a necessity (in a certain degree, perhaps)
inseparable from the nature of the old process, and the
effects of prescriptive custom, as exercised by unenlightened
masters.</p>

<p class="hanging">The unerring and perfect performance of the Association’s
new Machinery, coupled with its simplicity of construction,
its great effective power, and its ease of management.</p>

<p class="hanging">The great importance of its certain effect in the immediate
extinction of accidental fire in chimneys.</p>

<p class="hanging">The great practical economy effected to the public through
the perfect operation of the Machines, and the consequent
incalculable increase of convenience in the domestic
arrangements,—as all the chimneys of a house can be perfectly
swept at one visit, in much less time than is now required;
with a guaranteed security, for the due performance
of the specific duty undertaken, and against
injury or loss from carelessness, mismanagement, or
depredation.</p>

<p class="hanging">The Association has also in view the very important objects of
affording complete relief to the entire class of sweeping
adults and children, by elevating them from their present
degraded and enslaved condition to the rank of well-ordered,
decently-appointed, and justly-paid workmen.</p>

<p class="hanging">The date of each application for sweeping chimneys in a
house, and of the execution of the order, with the names
of the workmen employed, will be entered in the books of
the Association, at their principal office, 34, Foley-place:
thus affording satisfactory proof, in cases of fire, of the
chimneys having been properly swept, where the cause of
fire may be the subject of legal controversy; and preventing
any disposition on the part of the labourer to commit
petty offences, from the absolute certainty of immediate
detection.</p>

</div>

<p>The PATENT RAMONEUR ASSOCIATION, to carry out
these great objects, have appointed respectable persons as Agents
to receive orders; and will employ workmen of known good character,
provided with suitable dresses to carry on the operation;
giving them thus a cleaner and more decent appearance, when
not absolutely employed at work, than is at present witnessed;
and who, in lieu of the scanty and precarious pittance hitherto
allowed them, will receive wages of sufficient amount to afford
them the comforts and secure to them the self-respect enjoyed by
other mechanical labourers.</p>

<p>The Association beg to inform the Nobility, Gentry, and Public,
that, under these arrangements, on application being made at the
Central Office, a workman and assistant will attend with the Machine,
and, if necessary at the first trial, the Superintendent will
himself be present at the operation. The usual rate charged for
each chimney, under the old system of Machinery, will not be exceeded;

<p class="center">MOST IMPORTANT INVENTION.</p>

<p class="dropcap">THE PATENT STUCCO PAINT CEMENT.—This
truly valuable preparation, the satisfactory
result of a long series of experiments, after having been subjected
to the most rigid tests, is now offered with confidence to
the public, as possessing the following extraordinary qualities,
which must at once insure for it a preference over any Cement
yet manufactured.</p>

<p>Architects, Engineers, Contractors, Builders, Masons, Plasterers,
and the Trade are referred to the undermentioned properties
of this valuable discovery, which is secured by Patent to
its Inventors and Proprietors.</p>

<p>1. Its strong adhesive properties, fixing most tenaciously to the
smoothest surfaces, even to glass.</p>

<p>2. Its being highly repellent of water, and thoroughly impervious
to wet or damp.</p>

<p>3. The chemical peculiarity of its composition does not admit
of the possibility of its vegetating, and thereby becoming discoloured.</p>

<p>4. The safe and gradual rapidity with which it dries; hardening
the more by the greater exposure to the atmosphere.</p>

<p>5. Its perfect freedom from any of the caustic qualities of Lime
Stuccoes; and consequently,</p>

<p>6. It may be painted upon as soon as dry, a property possessed
by no other Cement whatever.</p>

<p>7. It is not in the slightest degree affected by frost.</p>

<p>8. It may be kept in the cask as delivered from the Manufactory
for any length of time without deterioration, not requiring
to be used (as other Cements are) immediately after being
manufactured. To Merchants, therefore, and Exporters, even to
the remotest parts of the globe, this Cement will form a most
important item of commerce.</p>

<p>9. To Engineers and Conductors of Public Works, the use of
this Cement is strongly recommended in lieu of mortar, particularly
in the construction of Railway Arches and Tunnelling; its
peculiarly tenacious property forming one hardened mass with
the brick or masonry, or with whatever material it may be used;
and it will be found particularly valuable in laying and pointing
roofs, whether of slate or tile, in the most exposed situations,
rendering the whole roof fixed and immoveable.</p>

<p>This Cement is sold in a fluid state, fit for its mixture with the
sand, at 14s. per cwt.: the proportions being one fourth-part of
the fluid to three-fourths of sand, thereby reducing the price of
this Cement considerably below that of any other yet offered to
the public.</p>

<p>One coat of the Cement, so prepared, is sufficient to cover at
once a Brick Front, without any preparatory coat of lime, seven
pounds of the fluid Cement being consumed in covering the
square yard; but when laid on Lime Plaster, four pounds’
weight to the square yard will be found enough.</p>

<p>Messrs. Johns and Co., of Plymouth (the Patentees), are now
prepared to execute orders to any extent; and beg to intimate
that they have appointed Messrs. Mann and Co., of No. 5,
Maiden-lane, Queen-street, London, as their Sole Agents, at
whose Warehouse any quantity may be procured, specimens
may be seen, and every information obtained, and to whom
all communications are to be addressed.</p>

<p class="dropcap">MOSLEY’S METALLIC PENS.—The decided
superiority of these Pens over all others has long
been acknowledged by the Public, and MOSLEY and Co., by
anxiously embracing every opportunity of improving their manufacture,
have at length brought them to such a state of perfection,
as utterly to defy competition. M. &amp; Co. in returning
thanks for the very liberal support they have received, would beg
at the same time to observe, that us few persons can write with
the same description of Pen, they have manufactured a great
variety of kinds, being thus enabled to suit the hand-writing of
all.</p>

<p>MOSLEY’S PENS are sold by all stationers, and other respectable
pen dealers throughout the Kingdom, and Wholesale at
No. 8, Hatton Garden, London.</p>

<p>To guard against the many spurious imitations palmed upon
the Public, every genuine Pen is stamped “RICHARD MOSLEY
&amp; Co. London,” and it is requisite that particular attention
be paid to this circumstance, as the name of MOSLEY has
been marked upon articles of a worthless description, the name
being wrongly spelled, or the Christian name left out—“RICHARD
MOSLEY &amp; Co. London,” is the only genuine
stamp.</p>

durable of any yet introduced; it is a fact worthy of remark, that
every new letter that has been brought out within the last ten
years has been Bentley’s invention: also Bentley’s newly-invented
Zinc and Brass Shop Window Plates, both flat and circular,
with raised letters, without a particle of wax, which never
get out of order. The Queen’s, Prince Albert’s, and the Prince

the proprietors (FAIRS and CO.) to an effort for their more
general adoption, in furtherance of which they have prepared a
graduated and greatly reduced tariff of prices, which will be forwarded,
post-paid, on application to Fairs and Co., 22, Mortimer-street,

<p class="dropcap">SMITH’S PATENT IMPROVED WATER-CLOSET
combines all the requisites considered indispensable
to form a perfect machine of this nature. In its action it is rapid,
certain, and complete; simplicity of construction (the want of
which in every other kind has been the fruitful and constant
source of so much perplexity) is the distinguishing characteristic
of Smith’s Patent Improved Water-Closet.</p>

<p>The value of these Closets has been confirmed, after the
severest tests in which they could be subjected, by persons holding
important situations in various public institutions, and must
be considered conclusive in a matter so nearly affecting the comfort
and convenience of the establishments under their care.
Such is the confidence of the Patentee in the completeness of
this invention, that he distinctly holds himself responsible for
the perfect action of every Closet fixed under his own superintendence,
and undertakes to remove, free of expense, any that
may be found not to fulfil the conditions of his prospectus.</p>

<p class="center larger">DOUBLE PATENT PERRYIAN FILTER INKSTAND.</p>

<p class="center">JAMES PERRY and Co., Manufacturers to Her Majesty and H. R. H. Prince Albert,</p>

<p class="noindent">Having effected considerable improvement in their FILTER INKSTAND, have
now the pleasure to announce that a Second Patent has been granted to
them for such improvement, which they have united with their First
Patent, under the title of “DOUBLE PATENT PERRYIAN FILTER INKSTAND.”
The eulogy bestowed on the <i>Patent Filter Inkstand</i> by the public
journals, and the preference obtained for them over the common Inkstands,
were almost unprecedented. The present novel and scientific method
of supplying Clear Ink to the Dipping Cup, and returning it into the
reservoir, is exceedingly simple, the action being now performed by
merely lifting up the lid to obtain a supply, and shutting it down to
withdraw it; in this state it is protected from dust or other injury in
any place or climate. When the Inkstand is filled, it is always ready for
use, and the writer will have a regular and daily supply of Clear Ink for
four or six months.</p>

<p class="center b">TESTIMONIALS.</p>

<p>It possesses the advantage, from being air-tight, of preserving Ink for
almost any period of time.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>One of the most useful inventions of the present day that has come under
our observation.—<i>Morning Herald.</i></p>

<p>It is really most ingenious, and not in the slightest degree liable to
get out of order.—<i>John Bull.</i></p>

<p>Very ingeniously constructed to keep the surface of the Ink at a uniform
level, where it is presented to the dip of the Pen.—<i>Morning Post.</i></p>

<p>We have tested the PERRYIAN INKSTAND, and have every reason to be
perfectly satisfied with the trial.—<i>Atlas.</i></p>

<p class="center larger">PATENT PERRYIAN GRAVITATING INKSTAND.</p>

<p class="center"><i>As Cheap as the Common Inkstand.</i></p>

<p class="noindent">This neat and novel invention is exceedingly well adopted for general
use; it preserves the Ink in great perfection for months together,
without the trouble of refilling; it excludes dust, &amp;c., and at any
moment the writer is supplied with Ink in the most perfect state.</p>

<p>The Patentees strongly recommend it to the notice of Bankers, Merchants,
Solicitors, Government Offices, Public Companies, Shops, Schools, &amp;c.,
as a great improvement over the ordinary Inkstand, both as regards
convenience, and considerable saving of Ink. This Inkstand will be found
invaluable in keeping the Ink always clear and fit for use in every
climate. It is of a cylindrical form, with a gravitating action, adjusted
so as to supply the Dipping Cup with Ink, which can be returned into
the Cylinder when not in use. Economy, cleanliness, and usefulness are
secured by it, and it cannot get out of order.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">“THE BUILDER.”</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">THE BUILDER.—This Journal will be exclusively
devoted to the interests of Builders, by
which term must be understood all that numerous and
wealthy portion of persons connected directly or indirectly
with Building. It will partake of the character of
a Trade Journal or Magazine, and also fulfil the objects
of a Weekly Newspaper, by giving a faithful and impartial
abstract of the News of the Week. The Conductors
will not discuss the question of general Politics, nor
will they enter upon Political disquisition at all, unless
any measure should be proposed affecting the class
whose interests they will always support and defend.
Upon such occasions, and upon such occasions only, will
their paper be political. It will be of no party, unless,
indeed, the advocating the true interests of all classes
connected with the Building Business, from the Labourer
to the Architect, can be so considered. A portion of</p>

<p class="center">“THE BUILDER”

<p class="noindent">will be occupied by Essays on the Building and Furnishing
Arts in all their various and numerous branches. It
will contain the designs of Ancient Buildings and Works,
and of those of our own day—not mere pictures or views
from which nothing is to be learnt, but plans, sections,
&amp;c., which, while they will be rendered perfectly intelligible
to workmen of ordinary information, it is hoped will
not be below the notice of the Architect and the Amateur.</p>

<p>When we consider how numerous and important is the
class to whose interests this Journal is dedicated; a class
of British Artisans numbering at least half a million;
a class whose trade-education distinguishes them in
intellect, knowledge, and wealth, it can only form matter
of surprise, that while the Clerical, Medical, Legal,
Military, and Naval, the Artists and Literati, and other
classes have their public organs of opinion and information;
while the Gardeners and Agriculturists, Railway and
Commercial and Banking Companies have each their
mouth-piece and record; the religious sects, and all
Politicians their special advocates that this most numerous,
most intelligent, and most wealthy, should have
so long remained without this bond of the Press; to instruct
and inform, to disseminate knowledge as to discoveries
and inventions, to advertise wants, and form for
it a general nucleus of strength, light, and union.</p>

<p class="noindent">To which, if we add for Ireland, for apprentices and
increase of population, we shall have a number probably
far exceeding half a million!</p>

<p>That this description of paper has been long a desideratum,
is evinced by the history and character of the associations
of years past. The struggles on the part of
masters and men, and the attitude taken by the public
towards both, required an interlocutor of this nature to
promote a good understanding, and to secure equity and
justice to all. With such an auxiliary, what waste of
time and funds had been avoided—what noble projects
carried out—what petty strife suppressed—what distractions
kept down. Our dignity would have been
maintained, and our cause ennobled.</p>

<p>But more than this. How many of the claims of humble
merit have slept in this interval for the want of a
friendly expositor, or a common vehicle of publicity?
And how many valuable inventions have languished wanting
encouragement, or died still-born in the obscurity of
their birth? How many toilsome wanderings of the artisan
in search of employment might have been avoided?—how
many common benefits have been withheld?—How
frequently the hand of brotherly charity undirected,
and the worthy object frustrated of its aid? In the glut
of work in one quarter and its scarcity in another, how
promptly would</p>

<p class="center">“THE BUILDER”</p>

<p class="noindent">have adjusted the balance? Its columns at all times open
to inquiries, and the office for reference, would have
solved many difficulties, and facilitated many purposes of
good.</p>

<p>But “better late than never.” The present effort will
be under the chief conduct of one who, from his experience
and practice, has derived means and opportunities of
knowing the wants, and understanding the interests, of
the class to whom he has the honour to belong. And it
will be the object at all times to enlist in behalf of this
enterprise the talent and services of all superior minds
and zealous hearts in the various kindred professions.</p>

<p>The paper will be of a convenient size for being bound
as a book, and so that the essays and illustrations may
be separated and preserved. As before stated in respect
of the political department, the Editor will endeavour to
steer clear of partizanship. But times may arise when a
fearless advocacy of trade interests will require him to
oppose or support the party in power; on such occasions
he will claim for himself the right to assert his views,
and those of his class, in a manly and temperate manner.</p>

<p>The illustrations will consist of views, plans, elevations,
and sections of ancient and modern buildings, and
of parts of buildings, so as effectually to describe their
peculiar excellencies;—of working drawings and diagrams
for the carpenter, mason, cabinet-maker, &amp;c. &amp;c.;—designs
of manufactured articles and implements used
in building;—of improved associations and architectural
arrangements, whether in the cottage or the mansion,
the villa or the palace, in the farm, the village, and the
city; in short, there will be no subject in art or science
connected with building and the furnishing of buildings
that will not be sought after to be introduced here.</p>

<p>As a medium of Advertisements, its merits will be
obvious: the list already given comprehends a large
number of those to whom such a paper as this offers
always the only proper vehicle. But there are many
besides to whom it will be a welcome organ. In the
matter of contracts for building, of business to be disposed
of or sought after, of workmen wanted or seeking
employment, and in all such pertaining to the class of
builders and cabinet makers, it will at once form a perfect
scheme of publicity, thereby encouraging many to
advertise, in the certainty of their advertisements being
read, and many to read in the same certainty of finding
an answer to their wants.</p>

<p class="dropcap">TESSELLATED PAVEMENT.—WYATT,
PARKER, and CO. respectfully call the attention of the
Public to their Specimens of Tessellated Pavement which may be
seen at Albion Wharf, Holland-street, Surrey Foot of Blackfriars-bridge.</p>

<p>The Tesseræ for forming this Pavement or Flooring, being
composed of similar material to that used in the manufacture of
porcelain, and highly vitrified, are imperishable. They can be
had of any size and form, from cubes of a quarter of an inch, and
with the colours burnt throughout the entire body. If required,
they may be gilt similar to those on the tombs of Edward the
Confessor and Henry the Third. They are prepared to execute
designs for these floors, or to dispose of the small Quarries or
Tesseræ by the gross, to such persons as may wish to execute
their own floors. These Tesseræ may be united on the floor
with Roman Cement, Lime, and Pozzolano, Plaster of Paris, or
most of the Cements now in use; or prepared in slabs, and laid
with the same facility as Portland Stone paving.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="dropcap">ENCAUSTIC or INLAID ORNAMENTAL
TILES, for paving churches, halls, corridors, &amp;c.—WYATT,
PARKER, and Co. beg to acquaint the public that
they are now prepared to execute PAVEMENTS with these
beautiful tiles, manufactured in imitation of the best ancient
examples from the Chapterhouse, Westminster, Winchester
Cathedral, Romsey Church, Great Malvern, &amp;c. Being made of
the famous red Staffordshire clay, they are of a less porous body
than the ancient tiles, consequently are more durable, and will
bear the roughest usage to which a foot-pavement can be subject,
and are therefore more economical than any of the marbles and
stones now in use for similar purposes. W. P., and Co. also
have a great variety of other tiles of various colours for flooring,
and white glazed tiles for the sides of stoves, dairies, baths, &amp;c.
Specimens may be seen at Wyatt, Parker, and Co.’s wharf,
Holland-street, Surrey Foot of Blackfriars-bridge.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="dropcap">ARTISTS, PRINTSELLERS, and Others
are respectfully informed that C. F. Brelefeld has formed a
large Collection of new and elegant Designs for Picture Frames
in the Improved Papier Maché. The superiority of these Frames
consists in their having all the effect of old carved work; many
patterns represent exactly the finest carvings of the 17th century.
The small parts are far less liable to injury than putty
work. Papier Maché being a remarkably tough and hard substance,
it never shrinks, and takes gilding very freely; the frames
do not weigh one quarter the weight of others, and the price is
below that usually charged.</p>

<p>Many specimens are now on view at C. F. Brelefeld’s Papier
Maché Works, No. 15, Wellington-street North, Strand, where
also Pattern Books may be had, price 14s., consisting of a
variety of Patterns of Picture and Glass Frames and Window
Cornices, already executed, and on sale.</p>

<p>“PICTURE FRAMES.—We direct the especial attention of
all persons interested in this subject to the frames for pictures
manufactured by Mr. Brelefeld; they are of Papier Maché, and
the advantages they possess over the ordinary composition frames
are so strong and so numerous, that they must inevitably be
brought into general use. They look exceedingly attractive, and
are in reality as much so as if they had passed through the hands
of the carver, and been produced at about ten times the expense.
The gilding tells with very brilliant effect; and no matter how
elaborate the pattern may be, they have a clearness and sharpness
that we have seldom or never seen obtained in composition.”—Art-Union.</p>

<p class="center">TO CIVIL ENGINEERS, ARCHITECTS, BUILDERS, AND
THE PUBLIC.</p>

<p class="dropcap">THOMAS PEAKE’S TERRO-METALLIC
MANUFACTORIES, Tunstall, near Newcastle, Staffordshire.
Depôt, Albion Wharf, Holland-street, London, per
Messrs. Wyatt, Parker, and Co.</p>

<p>The manufacturer and his late father have conducted the present
business since 1808, now thirty-four years. He begs to remark
that, during that period, the articles have supplanted other
materials to a considerable extent provincially; and experience
leads him to believe that they will be more generally adopted in
the metropolis, as they become known.</p>

<p>T. P. had the honour to supply roof tiles for lodges, villas, &amp;c.
at Chatsworth, and he believes they are not excelled in efficiency
or appearance by any tiled roofs in the world.</p>

<p>Pipes instead of Parget for chimneys, either circular for masonry,
or 14 by 9 in., and other forms and sizes, not to injure the
bond of brickwork; Grecian, Italian, pan, plain, and ornamental
tiles, instead of slates, for roofs, with tiles for the hips,
valleys, and ridges, a desirable substitute for lead, those for ridges
with pyramidal points, lilies, &amp;c.; paving tiles, 6, 7½, and 9 in.
square, blue and red, to lay in checquer; skirting tiles; garden
edging tiles, very neat; channel tiles; sough grate tiles; drain
shell tiles; conduit pipes, of various diameters, from 3 to 16 in.,
with dead or socket joints, also conical, to fit one within another—the
12 and 16 in. are well adapted fur small sewers. Great
numbers of the different sorts and sizes of these pipes have been
used upon the railways, especially the London and Birmingham,
the Great Western, and Birmingham and Gloucester lines. At
home and abroad they are preferred to lead, iron, &amp;c., to convey
water for domestic use. The paving of this material, whether
square or oblong, is clean, efficient, and durable; it is well
adapted for ground floors in general, for outyards, footpaths in
towns, &amp;c.</p>

partner of the firm of Pellatt and Green, many years since removed
from St. Paul’s churchyard to the Falcon Glass Works,
Holland-street, Blackfriars, which is the only establishment in
London where every operation connected with glass manufacture
(as blowing, cutting, engraving, stoppering, &amp;c.) may be seen in
full operation every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. For a

extensive show-rooms contain a large assortment of decanters,
wine glasses, desert services, toilet and smelling bottles, medical
and philosophical glass ware, crystal renaissance chandeliers,
massive, highly refractive, and decorated with large arabesque
ornamental drops, easily cleaned; also girandoles, candlesticks,
&amp;c. The china and earthenware comprise breakfast, dinner,
desert, tea, and chamber services, from the best manufacturers;
together with an extensive selection of Etruscan, Italian, and
other vases, modelled and executed by the most able artists at
Messrs. Wedgwood’s works, at Etruria, including his celebrated
